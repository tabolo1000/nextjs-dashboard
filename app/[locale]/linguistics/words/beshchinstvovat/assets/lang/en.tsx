                    The word <Highlight>rampage</Highlight> comes from the root{" "}
                    <strong>chin</strong>, denoting order or service, and the prefix{" "}
                    <strong>bes-</strong>, which indicates the negation or absence of
                    something. Thus, to go on a <Highlight>rampage</Highlight> literally
                    means to act without order, to violate the established order.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>rampage</Highlight> indicates a disturbance of
                    public or social order. In ancient and medieval times,{" "}
                    <Highlight>chin</Highlight> was associated with an established
                    hierarchy, official duties, and order in society. Those who violated
                    this order could be called <Highlight>disorderly</Highlight> because
                    their actions went against the law, tradition, or established rules.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Historically, rioting has often accompanied periods of social unrest
                    or political turmoil. At such times, people, feeling free from the
                    control of the authorities, could start to disrupt public order,
                    engage in pogroms, destruction, and other acts of vandalism. In
                    literature and historical chronicles, the word{" "}
                    <Highlight>riot</Highlight> was often used to describe such
                    situations.

            <Section title="Modern Meaning">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    In modern parlance, to <Highlight>go on a rampage</Highlight> means to
                    commit disorderly, hooligan, or vandalistic acts. It indicates a
                    violation of established norms and rules, both social and legal. Most
                    often, the word is used in the context of riots, street hooliganism,
                    or vandalism, where people's actions go beyond the limits of what is
                    allowed and lead to chaos and destruction.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>rampage</Highlight> has a close connection with
                    the concept of <Highlight>chin</Highlight>, which is still used today
                    in the meaning of position, status, or order. Interestingly, in
                    Russian, the word <Highlight>official</Highlight> refers to a person
                    who holds a certain position in the civil service, which is also
                    associated with the concept of order and organization. Thus, to{" "}
                    <Highlight>go on a rampage</Highlight> is the exact opposite behavior,
                    where established laws and norms are violated.

      "content": [
        "The word 'rampage' indicates a disturbance of public or social order. In ancient and medieval times, 'chin' was associated with an established hierarchy, official duties, and order in society. Those who violated this order could be called 'disorderly' because their actions went against the law, tradition, or established rules.",
        "Historically, rioting has often accompanied periods of social unrest or political turmoil. At such times, people, feeling free from the control of the authorities, could start to disrupt public order, engage in pogroms, destruction, and other acts of vandalism. In literature and historical chronicles, the word 'riot' was often used to describe such situations."

    {
      "title": "Modern Meaning",
      "content": "In modern parlance, to go on a rampage means to commit disorderly, hooligan, or vandalistic acts. It indicates a violation of established norms and rules, both social and legal. Most often, the word is used in the context of riots, street hooliganism, or vandalism, where people's actions go beyond the limits of what is allowed and lead to chaos and destruction."

      "title": "Interesting Fact",
      "parity": true,
      "content": "The word 'rampage' has a close connection with the concept of 'chin,' which is still used today in the meaning of position, status, or order. Interestingly, in Russian, the word 'official' refers to a person who holds a certain position in the civil service, which is also associated with the concept of order and organization. Thus, to go on a rampage is the exact opposite behavior, where established laws and norms are violated."

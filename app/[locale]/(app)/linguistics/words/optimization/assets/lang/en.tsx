                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>"optimization"</Highlight> comes from the Latin *optimus*, meaning "best." The root *opt-* is also found in words like *optimum* (the highest result) and *optimist* (a person inclined to see the best). Thus, optimization is associated with the process of bringing something to its best, most efficient, or most beneficial state.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>1. Latin Roots:</Highlight> The Latin *optimus* (best) combined with the suffix *-ation* forms a word that denotes the process of achieving the best result.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>2. Modern Usage:</Highlight> The word "optimization" appeared in the Russian language in the 19th-20th centuries, primarily used in scientific and technical contexts. Over time, it began to be applied in various fields where improving efficiency, enhancing processes, or minimizing costs was necessary.

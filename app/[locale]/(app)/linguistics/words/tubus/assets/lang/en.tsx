                    A <Highlight>tubus</Highlight> is a cylindrical case, usually made of a hard material (plastic, cardboard, or metal), designed to store and transport long, flexible items such as drawings, posters, maps, documents, as well as optical instruments and tools.

            <Section title="Historical Context">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Tubes started being used in the 19th century when there was a need to safely transport large-format drawings, maps, and other documents that could not be folded without risk of damage. The cylindrical shape of a tubus proved to be the most suitable for rolling paper or fabric into a tube, providing protection against mechanical damage, moisture, and dirt.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    With the development of optical instruments such as microscopes and telescopes, tubuses also began to be used in scientific and technical applications, where they served as an important part of the optical structure.

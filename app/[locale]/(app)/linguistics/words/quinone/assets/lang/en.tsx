                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Origin:</Highlight> The word <Highlight>quinone</Highlight> entered the Russian language from the German <Highlight>Chinon</Highlight>, which, in turn, derives from the name of the substance <Highlight>quinic acid</Highlight> (German: <Highlight>Chinas√§ure</Highlight>), extracted from the cinchona tree (<Highlight>Cinchona</Highlight>).
                    Quinic acid was one of the first known sources of quinones. The Latin name <Highlight>Cinchona</Highlight> originates from the name of the Countess of Chinch√≥n, the wife of the Viceroy of Peru, who was believed to have been cured of malaria by the bark of this tree.

                    Quinones are a class of organic compounds that represent cyclic diketones, i.e., molecules containing two carbonyl (C=O) groups incorporated into an aromatic ring. Quinones play an important role in biochemical processes and are widely used in industry.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    Formally, quinones can be seen as derivatives of aromatic hydrocarbons, where two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two oxygen atoms, forming two carbonyl groups.

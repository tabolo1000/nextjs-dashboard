                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>attention</Highlight> comes from the Old Russian word <Highlight>vnimati</Highlight>, which meant "to listen," "to heed," or "to hear." In turn, this word is related to the root <Highlight>imati</Highlight>, meaning "to take" or "to perceive." Thus, originally, <Highlight>attention</Highlight> involved the process of perceiving information through hearing, but over time, its meaning expanded to a broader concept of focusing on an object or phenomenon.

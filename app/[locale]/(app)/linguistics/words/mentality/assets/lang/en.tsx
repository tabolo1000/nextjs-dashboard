            <Section title="Factors influencing the formation of mentality">
                <ul className="unordered_list">
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>History:</Highlight> Historical events, such as wars, revolutions, periods of prosperity, or crisis, have a huge influence on shaping the worldview and mentality of a people. For example, the mentality in post-Soviet countries was largely formed under the influence of their socialist past.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>Culture and Traditions:</Highlight> Customs, folklore, religious beliefs, and norms of behavior passed down from generation to generation form a unique cultural code that influences people's mentality. For instance, Eastern cultures often emphasize collectivism and respect for elders, while Western cultures may be more oriented toward individualism.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>Geographical and Climatic Conditions:</Highlight> Geography and climate can also influence mentality. For example, people living in harsh climatic conditions often develop survival skills, patience, and a culture of mutual aid. Conversely, in regions with milder climates, a more relaxed and optimistic approach to life may prevail.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>Economic and Social Conditions:</Highlight> The standard of living, access to education, and the social structure of society also play a key role in shaping mentality. For example, societies with high levels of social inequality may develop stronger traits of competition and individualism.

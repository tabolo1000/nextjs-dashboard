            <Section title="Etymology of the Word 'Result'">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>"result"</Highlight> entered the Russian language from the Latin <Highlight>*resultatus*</Highlight>, meaning "yield," "echo," or "consequence." The Latin <Highlight>*resultare*</Highlight> is derived from the verb <Highlight>*salire*</Highlight>, meaning "to jump" or "to leap." In a literal translation, <Highlight>*resultare*</Highlight> can be interpreted as "to bounce back" or "to return," symbolizing the outcome of actions or events.

                    The Latin word <Highlight>*resultare*</Highlight> initially referred to a physical action‚Äîsomething that bounces back or is the consequence of a previous action. Over time, the word began to be used in a more abstract sense to denote the outcomes of actions.

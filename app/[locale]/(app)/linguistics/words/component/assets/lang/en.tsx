                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Origin:</Highlight> The word <Highlight>component</Highlight> entered the English language from the Latin <Highlight>componentis</Highlight>, meaning *constituting* or *combining*. The Latin <Highlight>componentis</Highlight> derives from the verb <Highlight>componere</Highlight> ‚Äî *to compose*, *to arrange*, which is composed of two parts:
                </p>
                <ul className="unordered_list">
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>"com-"</Highlight> ‚Äî a prefix meaning *together* or *with*.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>"ponere"</Highlight> ‚Äî a verb meaning *to place*, *to position*, *to arrange*.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Thus, the word <Highlight>component</Highlight> originally referred to a part of something larger, which combines with other parts to create a whole.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>component</Highlight> was initially used in the context of mathematics, physics, and engineering to denote individual parts of complex systems. In philosophy and logic, it was employed to describe elements of an argument or the structure of reasoning.

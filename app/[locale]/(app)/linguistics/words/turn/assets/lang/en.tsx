                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Origin:</Highlight> The word <Highlight>turn</Highlight> comes from Old English <Highlight>turnian</Highlight>, which in turn has its roots in the Latin word <Highlight>tornare</Highlight>, meaning *to turn*, *to rotate*, or *to change direction*. The Latin word itself is derived from <Highlight>tornus</Highlight>, meaning a lathe or tool used for shaping by turning.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    In Old English, the word <Highlight>turn</Highlight> was used to describe physical movement or rotation. Over time, it gained broader meanings, encompassing both physical changes in direction and metaphorical uses such as shifts in focus, transformations, or changes in state.

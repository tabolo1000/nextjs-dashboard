                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>button</Highlight> came into the Russian language from Polish, where the word <i>knopka</i> means "small head" or "ball." This word, in turn, originates from the Dutch <i>knop</i>, meaning "bud," "cone," or "knot." In Russian, "button" started to refer to a small object that can be pressed or switched to perform a certain function.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    If we look into history, buttons as fasteners appeared long before they were used in mechanics or electronics. In ancient times, people used buttons, fasteners, and laces to secure clothing. However, in the mid-20th century, with the development of technology, buttons became a key element in managing electronic devices.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    The first mechanical buttons used in devices can be found on telephones and radios, providing simple and reliable control. With the rise of computers and mobile devices, buttons became an integral part of user interfaces.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    Virtual buttons appeared with the development of software interfaces and touch screens. They replaced physical buttons in many devices, such as smartphones and tablets.

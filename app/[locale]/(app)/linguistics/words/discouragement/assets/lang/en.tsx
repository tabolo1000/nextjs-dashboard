            <Section title="Etymology">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>discouraged</Highlight> comes from the French word {" "}
                    <Highlight>courage</Highlight>, which means "courage" or "bravery." The prefix {" "}
                    <Highlight>dis-</Highlight> and the suffix <Highlight>-ed</Highlight> form a word
                    that indicates the result of an action leading to the loss of courage or determination.
                    Thus, <Highlight>discouraged</Highlight> literally means "deprived of courage" or
                    "deprived of confidence."

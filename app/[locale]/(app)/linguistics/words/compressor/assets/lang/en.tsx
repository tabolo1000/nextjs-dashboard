                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>compressor</Highlight> comes from the Latin <em>compressor</em>, which in turn is formed from the verb <em>comprimere</em> ‚Äî <strong>to compress</strong>. The suffix <Highlight>-or</Highlight> indicates a tool or mechanism that performs the action. Thus, <Highlight>compressor</Highlight> literally means a device for compressing something, often air or gas.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    The term <Highlight>compressor</Highlight> appeared in the technical and engineering environment with the development of technologies related to the control of air and gas pressure. The first compressors, as devices for compressing air or gas, began to be used in industry and construction in the 19th century.

                    Compressors are divided into several types depending on the principle of operation:

                <ul className="unordered_list">
                    <li><strong>Piston compressors</strong> ‚Äî operate by the movement of a piston, which compresses air or gas in a cylinder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Screw compressors</strong> ‚Äî use the rotation of screws to compress the gas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Centrifugal (turbochargers)</strong> ‚Äî compress air using centrifugal force created by the rotor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rotary compressors</strong> ‚Äî use rotating elements to compress and move gas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diaphragm compressors</strong> ‚Äî operate by moving the diaphragm, which changes the volume of the chamber and compresses the gas.</li>

            <Section title="Interesting Fact">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    One of the most famous types of compressors is the turbocharger, which is used in car engines to increase their power. A turbocharger compresses the air entering the engine, allowing more fuel to be burned and thus increasing power without increasing the engine's volume.

            <Section title="Definition">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    A <Highlight>pyromaniac</Highlight> is a woman suffering from a pathological attraction to fire and arson. Pyromania (in a more general sense) is a mental disorder in which a person feels an uncontrollable desire to watch fire or set fires. A pyromaniac may feel satisfaction or relief from watching fire or the results of their actions.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Pyromania, regardless of gender, is a rare mental disorder and is classified as an impulse-control disorder, in which a person cannot regulate their actions.

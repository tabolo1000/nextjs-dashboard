                Etymology of the word "Authentication"
            </h1>

            <Section title="Etymology">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>authentication</Highlight> comes from the Latin <em>authenticus</em>, which in turn goes back to the Greek <em>Œ±·ΩêŒ∏ŒµŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ</em> (<em>authentikos</em>), meaning <strong>genuine</strong>, <strong>true</strong>. The suffix <Highlight>-tion</Highlight> indicates a process or action. Thus, <Highlight>authentication</Highlight> literally means the process of confirming the authenticity or truth of something.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    The term <Highlight>authentication</Highlight> began to be actively used in the middle of the 20th century with the development of computer technology and information systems. Initially, it denoted the process of confirming the authenticity of a person or document, but with the spread of the internet and digital technologies, the importance of authentication has increased.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Before the advent of modern computer systems, <Highlight>authentication</Highlight> was of greater importance in legal and administrative contexts, where confirming the authenticity of signatures, manuscripts, and documents played an important role. In the digital age, the authentication process has come to be applied in the context of access to systems, services, and data, such as user accounts, banking systems, corporate networks, and other secure resources.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    In today's world, <Highlight>authentication</Highlight> is the process of verifying the identity of a person or object, usually for the purpose of granting access to a particular system, service, or information. Authentication is a critical element of security in information technology, protecting data from unauthorized access.

            <Section title="Fun Fact">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become the security standard for many online services and applications. Implementing MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, as it becomes much more difficult for an attacker to gain control of an account by requiring not only knowledge of the password, but also confirmation through a second factor, such as receiving a one-time code on a cell phone.

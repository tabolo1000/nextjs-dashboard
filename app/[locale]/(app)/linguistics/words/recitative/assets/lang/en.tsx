            <Section title="Etymology of the word 'Recitative'">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Origin:</Highlight> The word <Highlight>recitative</Highlight> entered the Russian language through the French <Highlight>r√©citatif</Highlight> and Italian <Highlight>recitativo</Highlight>, both derived from the Latin <Highlight>recitare</Highlight>, meaning "to read aloud," "to tell," or "to recite." The root <Highlight>recitare</Highlight> is composed of two parts: <Highlight>re-</Highlight> (repetition) and <Highlight>citare</Highlight> (to call, to summon). Thus, recitative can be literally translated as "repeated recitation," which reflects the essence of this musical-poetic genre.

            <Section title="Definition of 'Recitative'">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Recitative</Highlight> is a form of musical declamation that lies between singing and speaking. In a recitative, the melodic line is often minimal, and the rhythm and intonation resemble normal speech more than traditional singing. It is used to deliver text or dialogue in a more natural, conversational manner than an aria or choral composition.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    In music, the recitative serves to quickly and clearly convey the plot, link musical numbers together, and prepare the listener for the more melodic and emotional parts of the piece.

            <Section title="Types of Recitative">
                <ul className="unordered_list">
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>Recitativo secco (dry recitative)</Highlight>: This is "dry" recitative, accompanied by minimal harmony, often just chords from a harpsichord or piano. It has little to no melody, and the primary focus is on the text. This type of recitative is used to convey large amounts of information, such as dialogue and narration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>Recitativo accompagnato (accompanied recitative)</Highlight>: Unlike secco, this recitative is accompanied by an orchestra, giving it a more emotional and expressive character. The orchestral accompaniment supports and highlights the intonations and emotional nuances of the text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>Recitative obbligato</Highlight>: A type of recitative where the orchestral accompaniment plays a more active and integrated role, not just supporting the vocal line.

            <Section title="Role of Recitative in Opera and Other Musical Genres">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    In classical opera, <Highlight>recitative</Highlight> is often used to advance the plot and convey dialogues between characters. Unlike arias, which express emotions and emphasize musical beauty, recitative focuses on the text and its content.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    In Baroque and Classical operas, recitatives served as a bridge between arias, duets, and ensembles. For example, in Mozart's operas, recitatives were often used to explain events that happened between arias and to develop the dramatic action.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Recitatives are also found in oratorios, cantatas, and other vocal works.

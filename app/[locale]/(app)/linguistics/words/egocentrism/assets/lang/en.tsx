                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Origin:</Highlight> The word <Highlight>egocentrism</Highlight> comes from the Latin words:
                </p>
                <ul className="unordered_list">
                    <li><Highlight>"ego"</Highlight> ‚Äî I, self.</li>
                    <li><Highlight>"centrum"</Highlight> ‚Äî center.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Therefore, <Highlight>egocentrism</Highlight> literally means "placing oneself at the center." This reflects the main idea of the concept ‚Äî the tendency of a person to perceive everything happening around them through the lens of their own interests, views, and needs.

            <Section title="Definition">
                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Egocentrism</Highlight> is a psychological term that describes a person's tendency to view themselves as the central figure in their world, with an inability or unwillingness to consider other people's points of view. An egocentric person tends to see actions and events primarily from the perspective of how they affect them and may not realize that others can have thoughts, feelings, and needs different from their own.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Egocentrism is often associated with an excessive focus on one's own needs and desires, which can lead to insufficient understanding or respect for the thoughts and feelings of others.

                        <Highlight>Child Development</Highlight>: In early childhood, children naturally tend to be egocentric. They are not yet able to fully understand that other people may have their own thoughts and feelings different from their own. The famous Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget described egocentrism as a normal stage of cognitive development. As children grow older, they begin to understand other people's points of view and learn to take them into account in their actions.

                        <Highlight>Adult Egocentrism</Highlight>: While egocentrism is often considered a characteristic of childhood, some adults may retain egocentric traits throughout life. This can manifest as an inability or unwillingness to understand other perspectives, making it difficult to build healthy interpersonal relationships.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <Highlight>Cognitive Egocentrism</Highlight>: This refers to the inability or difficulty in accepting another person's point of view in cognitive processes. For example, a person may assume that everyone thinks the same way they do or that their opinion is the only correct one.

                    <li>
                        <Highlight>Emotional Egocentrism</Highlight>: This is the tendency to focus on one's own emotions while ignoring the feelings and emotional experiences of others. An emotional egocentric may expect others to always respond to their emotional needs but fail to reciprocate.

This is a classic example of childhood egocentrism, where the child has difficulty understanding that others perceive the world differently.

                        <Highlight>In Adults</Highlight>: An adult may exhibit egocentrism if, for example, they expect their problems to be the most important to everyone around them, without considering that others may have their own concerns and difficulties.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    An egoist may consciously use others to achieve their goals, while an egocentric simply doesn't understand that their behavior might affect others.

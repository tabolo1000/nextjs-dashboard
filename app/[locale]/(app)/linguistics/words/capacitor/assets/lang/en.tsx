                    The word <Highlight>condenser</Highlight> comes from the Latin <em>condensare</em> ‚Äî to condense, thicken. The suffix <Highlight>-or</Highlight> indicates a device that performs a certain action. Thus, a <Highlight>capacitor</Highlight> is a device that performs the function of condensation or accumulation.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    A <Highlight>capacitor</Highlight> consists of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric (non-conductive material). When voltage is applied to the plates, positive charges accumulate on one of the plates and negative charges accumulate on the other. This results in an electric field between the plates, which stores energy.

                    <li><strong>Capacitance</strong>: The ability of a capacitor to store charge, measured in farads (F). The larger the area of the plates and the smaller the distance between them, the greater the capacitance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating Voltage</strong>: The maximum voltage at which a capacitor can operate without breaking down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polarity</strong>: For some types of capacitors (e.g., electrolytic capacitors), it is important to observe polarity when connecting them, otherwise they may fail.</li>

                <p className="paragraph">
                    In refrigeration systems (such as air conditioners and refrigerators), a **condenser** is a heat exchanger used to remove heat from the system. The condenser receives hot, gaseous refrigerant compressed by a compressor and cools it, turning it into a liquid. This process is called **condensation**. As the refrigerant passes through the condenser, it releases heat to the surrounding environment, allowing the system to maintain the desired temperature.

                    **Supercapacitors** are a relatively new category of capacitors that can store a significant amount of energy compared to conventional capacitors. They are used in applications such as hybrid cars, backup power systems, and for storing energy in renewable sources like solar panels and wind turbines.

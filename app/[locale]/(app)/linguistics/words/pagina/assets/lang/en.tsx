                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Origin:</Highlight> The word <Highlight>page</Highlight> entered English through Old French (<Highlight>page</Highlight>), which originally came from Latin <Highlight>pagina</Highlight>, meaning *sheet*, *strip*, or *page of a book*. The Latin term <Highlight>pagina</Highlight> itself derives from the verb <Highlight>pangere</Highlight>, which means *to fasten*, *plant*, or *drive in*. In ancient Rome, <Highlight>pagina</Highlight> referred to flat strips or boards used for writing, and eventually, the word came to be used for parchment sheets and pages in books.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    Initially, the term <Highlight>pagina</Highlight> described physical objects ‚Äî strips or boards for writing. Over time, as books became more common, especially after the invention of printing, the word took its current meaning: the individual sheets in a book. Now, it is also widely used in reference to digital media, such as web pages.

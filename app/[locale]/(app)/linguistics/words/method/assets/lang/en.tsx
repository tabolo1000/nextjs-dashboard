                    <Highlight>Origin:</Highlight> The word <Highlight>method</Highlight> came into the English language from the Latin <Highlight>methodus</Highlight>, which in turn derives from the Ancient Greek <Highlight>ŒºŒ≠Œ∏ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ</Highlight> (<Highlight>m√©thodos</Highlight>), meaning *way of investigation*, *way of knowing*. The Greek word consists of two parts:

                <p className="paragraph">
                    Initially, the word <Highlight>method</Highlight> in Greek referred to a path toward a goal, a means of reaching a result through investigation or problem-solving. The term was used to describe a systematic approach to acquiring knowledge, especially in philosophy and science.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    In ancient Greek philosophy and science, the word <Highlight>ŒºŒ≠Œ∏ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ</Highlight> was used to describe a systematic approach to investigation, the search for truth, or the development of solutions. It became a key term in the works of philosophers such as Aristotle, who actively used the concept of method to describe his approaches to studying nature and philosophical questions.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    During the Middle Ages, with the Latin borrowing, the word <Highlight>method</Highlight> entered scientific lexicons. It was used to describe systematic approaches to research in theology, philosophy, and natural science. In the Renaissance, when scientific methods began to be actively developed and systematized, the term "method" became foundational for describing the ways of scientific inquiry.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    In the 18th and 19th centuries, the word <Highlight>method</Highlight> became widely used in various fields of knowledge, from mathematics and physics to the humanities. It began to refer not only to scientific methods but also to pedagogical, technical, and sociological approaches to problem-solving.

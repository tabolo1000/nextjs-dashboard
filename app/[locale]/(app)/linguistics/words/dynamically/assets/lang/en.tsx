                <p className="paragraph">
                    The word <Highlight>"dynamically"</Highlight> comes from the Greek word <i>dynamis</i> (δύναμις), meaning "power", "force", or "movement". The root <Highlight>dyna-</Highlight> is used in words related to motion, change, or activity, such as "dynamics" and "dynamo". The suffix <Highlight>-ically</Highlight> indicates a manner of action or characteristic related to something.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Greek roots:</Highlight> <i>Dynamis</i> reflects the concept of power or energy that causes changes or movement. This word became the basis for many terms associated with change and development.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    <Highlight>Modern usage:</Highlight> In the English language, the word "dynamically" entered through scientific and technical terms related to physics, mathematics, and programming. It has come to denote processes that occur depending on changing conditions or over time.
